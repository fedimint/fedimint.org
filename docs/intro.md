Imagine a world where your community becomes its own bank, collectively managing and transacting Bitcoin while prioritizing privacy and accountability. That’s the power of Fedimint.

Fedimint is a modular, open-source protocol that reimagines how communities’ custody and transact Bitcoin. With privacy at its core, it empowers everyday people to take control of their financial future—together.

If you’re already comfortable self-custodying your Bitcoin and running your own nodes, fantastic! Keep doing that. But for those seeking an alternative to third-party custodians, Fedimint provides a robust and community-focused solution.

Fedimint unlocks new possibilities for Bitcoiners by bringing together trust, accountability, and privacy under one powerful protocol. It transforms Bitcoin custody from an individual task to a shared responsibility.
Think of it as community banking—but with Bitcoin, greater privacy, and no central bank.


Here’s a quick tour to get you up to speed on the Fedimint protocol. We’ll break down key concepts, trade-offs, technologies, and essential terms so you can navigate this innovative solution with confidence. We close this tour with an overview of several use cases we believe Fedimint can help with.


Our goal is simple: make understanding Fedimint as easy and engaging as possible.This documentation explains how Fedimint works, in a manner that is easily digestible by a non technical audience, inspired by the bitcoin.org wiki.

The following high level overview of the documentation was recorded for the [bitcoin design community](https://bitcoin.design) on 20th September 2022—and we’re just getting started. Now it’s your turn.


Thank you for being part of this exciting journey. Together, we’ll shape a future where communities reclaim their financial power through Bitcoin.
