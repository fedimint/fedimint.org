Imagine a world where your community becomes its own bank, collectively managing and transacting Bitcoin while prioritizing privacy and accountability. That’s the power of Fedimint.
Fedimint is a modular, open-source protocol that reimagines how communities’ custody and transact Bitcoin. With privacy at its core, it empowers everyday people to take control of their financial future—together.

If you’re already comfortable self-custodying your Bitcoin and running your own nodes, fantastic! Keep doing that. But for those seeking an alternative to third-party custodians, Fedimint provides a robust and community-focused solution.

This is a quick tour through the protocol to help you understand how it works and to answer questions around the trade offs, technologies, and common terms you might hear. We close this tour with an overview of several use cases we believe Fedimint can help with.

Our goal is simple: make understanding Fedimint as easy and engaging as possible, just like the user-friendly Bitcoin.org wiki. This documentation combines technical depth with accessible language to guide you through every step.

The following high level overview of the documentation was recorded for the [bitcoin design community](https://bitcoin.design) on 20th September 2022.
