# Fedimint Consensus

Because it takes such a central part in a federated mint, we will begin with explaining the properties of
[Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault) consensus algorithms.

A byzantine fault does not only allow a party to go offline, but also to maliciously continue participating in the
protocol. In the following we will use

$n$

as the total number of participants in a protocol and

$$f$$

as the maximum amount of faulty ones among them.

We define a BFT consensus algorithm as an algorithm that allows all honest parties to agree on a common
set of items as long as less or equal than

$$f$$

of the participants are malicious. These items may be contributed by any participant and there should be no risk of targeted censorship of items. One such protocol is [AlephBFT]. We will mainly use it as a reference for BFT consensus properties but note that similar but more efficient ones exist (most notably [Dumbo] and [hybrids] built on top of it).

We generally assume the consensus to run in rounds, producing a common subset of the contributions made by the
participants. At the start of each round each participant

$$i$$

is expected to propose a set of items

$$C_i$$

to the consensus.

After the BFT consensus algorithm has finished (note: this involves a lot of back-and-forth communication
which we ignore for now) every honest participant learns the same subset

$$C \subseteq \{C_1, \dots, C_n\}$$

The consensus set

$$C$$

contains at least

$$n-f$$

contributions from different participants. Note how this implies that
if more than

$$f$$

participants propose the same item, the said item is guaranteed to be included in the next consensus
output.

The consensus protocols we are discussing, asynchronous ones, can only handle about

$$\frac{1}{3}$$

faulty nodes, so this will also be our assumption when building our protocol on top if not stated otherwise.
