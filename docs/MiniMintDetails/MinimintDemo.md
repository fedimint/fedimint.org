# Fedimint

Fedimint is a modular federated eCash prototype still under heavy development written in Rust. It already supports all main operations (deposit/withdraw via both on-chain Bitcoin and Lightning, eCash transfers) and comes with a rudimentary CLI client. Some features are still missing and blocking mainnet deployments, but the project is moving quickly. If you are interested in contributing [check out the GitHub repository](https://github.com/fedimint/Fedimint).

This section contains the original architecture details shared on the Fedimint implementation.
